    "Stock is a highly sensitive and turbulent market. Because of the recent crisis between Russia and Ukraine, for example, a few comments from Putin or another powerful figure might lead millions of people to lose or make profit in a matter of minutes. A essential skill that modern people should have is the ability to foresee trends in order to preserve their investments and maximize their profits. In this blog, we are going to introduce three basic functions to support you to achieve the following goals.\n",

    "First, [selenium](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/) is the first option to support us to do web scraping from [Yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/predefined/aggressive_small_caps?offset=0&count=202) based on the filter we set up, such as Aggressive Small Caps. Here is a [Youtube selenium tutoria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjv1sY630Uc) that I recommend you to  set up selenium. And use this selenium python tutorial as more detailed reference. Then, we will get the historical data of that most active stock. Second, we will predict the stock trends. Eventually, we send out the predictions and the lastest change on the stock to our receiver by email."
